# Configure project hints

`project-hints.yaml` gives the Librarian a lightweight per-project topic list so it can **propose** which project a newly ingested paper belongs to — you confirm or correct that at triage, exactly like every other proposed field. It is **optional**: with no file, project membership is tagged fully by hand. This guide creates it from the shipped example and tunes it.

It is deliberately *not* a scoring matrix — there are no weights and no expected-method/design fields. That richer config was considered and rejected as drift-prone ([ADR-15](../../../project/adr/15-project-auto-classification.md)); a hint is just a topic list.

## Prerequisites

- The starter vault (ships `.memoria/project-hints.yaml.example`)
- The auto-proposal takes effect once the Librarian's `classify` step runs; the file is editable any time before that

## Steps

**1. Copy the example into place.**

```bash
cp .memoria/project-hints.yaml.example .memoria/project-hints.yaml
```

Copy-on-first-use. (Memoria-authored examples use lowercase `.example`; Hermes-generated ones like `.env.EXAMPLE` stay uppercase.) An absent `project-hints.yaml` simply means manual project tagging — nothing breaks without it.

**2. Declare one entry per active project.**

```yaml
projects:
  - id: phd-dissertation
    description: HCI + digital health — JITAI, receptivity, health coaching, equity, LLM mHealth.
    primary_topics: [jitai, receptivity-detection, health-coaching, mhealth, sensemaking, health-equity]
  - id: scoping-review
    description: Scoping review of just-in-time adaptive interventions in mHealth.
    primary_topics: [jitai, mhealth]
```

- `id` — a stable slug; this is the value that lands in a note's `projects` field.
- `description` — a one-line scope, free text. For your reference; not scored.
- `primary_topics` — the topic terms papers in this project tend to carry.

**3. Draw `primary_topics` from your actual `topic` vocabulary.**

At classify time the Librarian scores a paper's proposed `topic` values against each project's `primary_topics` by **simple overlap**. So the terms here must match the ones you actually use in the `topic` field — a `primary_topics` entry that never appears as a real `topic` contributes nothing. Keep to the ~30-term vocabulary discipline ([Wikilink and link conventions](../../reference/linking.md#vocabulary-discipline)).

**4. Keep it a hint, not a matrix.**

Do **not** add `expected_study_designs` or `expected_methods` blocks — they were rejected as drift-prone config (ADR-15); study design and method are proposed independently. There are no weights to tune; overlap is the whole mechanism.

**5. Re-tune when classification mis-routes.**

This is the file to edit when the symptom appears: if the Librarian keeps proposing the wrong project (or none) for papers that clearly belong somewhere, broaden or narrow that project's `primary_topics` so the overlap reflects how you actually tag. It's a hint you edit freely — no migration, no schema bump.

## Verify

- `.memoria/project-hints.yaml` exists (not just the `.example`).
- Each project entry has an `id` and a non-empty `primary_topics` list.
- After the next ingest + classify, the note's `_proposed_classification` proposes a `projects` value you can confirm at triage.
