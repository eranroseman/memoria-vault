# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label string from this table.

## Category roles

`/triage` also requires exactly one **category** role per triaged issue:

| Role          | Label in our tracker | Meaning                       |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `bug`         | `bug`                | Something is broken           |
| `enhancement` | `enhancement`        | New feature or improvement    |

## Labels outside the machine

These exist on the tracker but are not triage roles, and `/triage` neither reads
nor applies them:

- `documentation` — subject tag, applied at filing when it fits.
- `dependencies`, `python`, `github_actions`, `pre_commit` — written by
  Dependabot on its own pull requests.

An issue that has not been triaged carries no role at all. That is a meaningful
state, not an oversight.
