# Release-candidate run runbook

The reusable, version-agnostic run sheet that takes a **fresh clone on a clean
Ubuntu/WSL2 box** through stages **S0–S5** and the operability gates **G9–G11**,
recording each [gate](../../adr/29-testing-framework.md) green. Work top
to bottom; if a step fails, stop and file it — a candidate is green only when
every row is.

**Per release:** record each result in the relevant readiness/stage sub-issue under the
release parent issue. Copy the [sign-off template](#sign-off-template) into that
release's `validation-log.md` only when the issue/Actions trail needs a curated
long-lived summary. Gate/stage **state** never lives in this file (the procedure)
or the release plan (the prose/definitions).

The per-area detail lives in the linked plan docs; this sheet sequences them and
adds the exact commands plus the ingest/runtime setup.

This runbook is the `release-acceptance` layer. It consumes green Source and
Package Gate evidence, then adds the Runtime, Product, and Release Gate checks:
live Hermes, the Obsidian bridge, local services, GUI/Bases/dashboards, model
connectivity, workflow acceptance, telemetry, and cut readiness.

The automated prefix is:

```bash
scripts/verify rc
```

Attach or link its `summary.json` evidence in the release issue, then complete
the manual rows below.

## 0. Preconditions

- [ ] Clean **native Windows production** box for the attended production install, plus a clean **Ubuntu / WSL2** box for the Linux test installer.
- [ ] Local REST API HTTPS configured with `OBSIDIAN_MCP_PORT` and `OBSIDIAN_MCP_SSL_VERIFY`. On the WSL test box, Linux Obsidian opens the ext4 test vault on its native path; Windows Obsidian is only for Windows-hosted vaults, with mirrored networking if WSL Hermes deliberately talks to that Windows listener.
- [ ] Hermes installed and on `PATH` (`hermes version`).
- [ ] A **throwaway vault** dir for the install, e.g. `export RV=$HOME/Memoria-candidate`.
- [ ] Fresh clone: `git clone https://github.com/eranroseman/memoria-vault.git && cd memoria-vault` — record the commit (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`).
- [ ] The Hermes global `.env` has the scholarly-API keys (`S2_API_KEY`, `OPENALEX_API_KEY`, `NCBI_EMAIL`), `OBSIDIAN_API_KEY`, `OBSIDIAN_MCP_PORT`, and `OBSIDIAN_MCP_SSL_VERIFY`; the installer propagates them per profile. **Never print key values.**

## S0–S1 — static-contract + component  → records G6 (partial), S0, S1

```bash
scripts/verify pr                # Source Gate: l1 (component tests) + l0 (static)
```

- [ ] **S0 / static-contract** static (parse, LF endings, profile files present) — PASS.
- [ ] **S1 / component** the component test suite green (`scripts/test.sh l1` → `pytest tests/`): `policy_mcp`, `policy_hook`, `board_export`, `metrics_aggregate`, `retraction`, `detectors`, **and the ingest spine** (`ingest_paper`, `resolve_merge`, `link`, `extract`, `pipeline`, `sweeps`, `ingest_mcp`).
- [ ] Confirm CI is green on the same commit (the required checks gate — G6): `gh pr checks` / the Actions tab.

## PR-safe smoke — vault-assembly + workflow-replay  → records G6 (partial)

```bash
scripts/verify package
```

- [ ] **vault-assembly** builds a disposable vault, initializes git, wires executable hooks, verifies default CSS snippets and bundled plugins, and finishes fresh-vault integrity cleanly.
- [ ] **workflow-replay** reaches the ADR-80 Phase 1 model-free path, writes the expected artifacts, denies the known forbidden write with an audit row, and leaves no forbidden file.

## S2 — installer dry-run  → records S2

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh --dry-run --vault "$RV"
```

- [ ] Prints `DRY RUN — nothing will be changed`; `{{VAULT_PATH}}` / `{{PYTHON}}` substitutions resolve; no errors.

## S3 — real install into the throwaway vault  → records S3, G1

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh --vault "$RV"      # full install
hermes profile list                         # expect all 5
bash scripts/install.sh --vault "$RV"      # re-run: must be idempotent (no errors, no dupes)
```

- [ ] **G1 / S3** — installer completes; **all 5 profiles register** (`copi`, `librarian`, `writer`, `peer-reviewer`, `engineer`); the vault venv exists (`$RV/.memoria/.venv`); idempotent re-run is clean.
- [ ] `memoria-policy-gate` plugin deployed + enabled for all 5 (substituted `{{PROFILE}}`/`{{VAULT_PATH}}` per lane).
- [ ] Bundled official skills verified present (no hub-install 404s).
- [ ] Telemetry + sweeps crons wired: `hermes cron list` shows `memoria-board-export` and `memoria-sweeps`.
- [ ] **Ingest runtime deps:** `"$RV/.memoria/.venv/bin/python" -c "import pymupdf4llm"` succeeds (local-PDF extraction; from `requirements.txt`).

Detail: [Installer test plan](installer-test-plan.md).

## S4 — runtime-integration: model, bridge, gate enforcement  → records G2, G3, S4

- [ ] **Model connectivity** — a trivial `hermes` chat/zero-shot returns (provider reachable).
- [ ] **REST bridge (G3)** — start Obsidian on the test vault first (`obsidian ~/Memoria-test` on Linux/WSL, or Windows Obsidian for a Windows-hosted vault). Then verify the obsidian MCP reads **and** writes the vault via the Local REST API plugin's **native MCP over verified HTTPS** ([ADR-31](../../adr/31-native-obsidian-mcp.md)): set `OBSIDIAN_MCP_PORT` and `OBSIDIAN_MCP_SSL_VERIFY` in `~/.hermes/.env`, enable the plugin's HTTPS server on that port, reload the Obsidian window to bind it, and re-run `--profiles-only` after copying any changed API key or exported PEM path. The port lives in the URL, so the candidate and any other vault coexist on different ports — no need to close another vault.
- [ ] **Gate enforcement (G2)** in **all three run modes** — `hermes -z`, gateway (api_server), and cron — on installer-deployed lanes: an allowed write logs `allow` + `write_complete`; a denied/`dry_run` write is blocked with **no file**; a reached-but-erroring gate decision **fails closed**. A missing/unregistered plugin is a deploy failure, not a runtime policy outage.
- [ ] **Gate contract — Hermes drift:** `python src/.memoria/mcp/hermes_contract_doctor.py --vault ~/Memoria-test` exits 0 — every direct-capability and egress/side-effect tool the *installed* Hermes ships (file/terminal/code_execution/web/browser/messaging/computer_use/delegation/media/Home Assistant/spotify/cronjob toolsets) is hard-denied, and the deployed `policy_hook.py` matches `src/`. **Re-run after every Hermes upgrade**; this is what catches a new tool like `process` the denylist doesn't yet know. WARN lines for dead names are informational.
- [ ] **Local services** — local LLM endpoint, MCP servers, and Obsidian bridge checks are recorded as manual/nightly evidence, not as PR-required CI, until a stable self-hosted runner exists.

Detail: [Hermes CLI test plan](hermes-cli-test-plan.md), [Headless test plan](headless-test-plan.md).

## G9 — deterministic spine (zero-LLM card)  → records G9

- [ ] A *dispatched, zero-LLM* card (Linter operation `health-report` or Peer-reviewer `similarity-check`) completes live: dispatch → claim → run → **gated write** → audit → `done`.

Detail: [Deterministic-spine test plan (G9)](g9-spine-plan.md).

## G10 — ingest value loop (the product)  → records G10

**Ingest setup (once):**

- [ ] Better BibTeX **postscript** applied so the export carries `zoteroselect` (gives `zotero_uri` with no Zotero API) — snippet in [Ingest routing](../../reference/ingest.md#frontmatter-written-at-ingest). Re-export the `.bib`.
- [ ] A seeded `system/vocabulary.md` is present (ships with the vault).

**Run a real paper end-to-end** (Zotero capture → card, or a manual ingest card):

- [ ] Dispatch ingests through the `ingest_pipeline` MCP tool → the Librarian fills the two holes (vocabulary-constrained `_proposed_classification`; comparative `[!brief]`) → gated write → `lifecycle: proposed`, `ingest_status: complete`.
- [ ] Note is complete: identity + merged metadata (S2/OpenAlex/Crossref), stable IDs (`openalex_id`/`semantic_scholar_id`/`pmid`/`pmcid`), `zotero_uri` + `pdf_uri`, full-text extract under `.memoria/data/extracts/`, ID-keyed entity notes under `catalog/`, `[!brief]` leads the body.

Detail: [Ingest-value-loop test plan (G10)](g10-ingest-plan.md).

## G11 — review loop closes  → records G11

- [ ] Card reaches `done` with the review requested; a **human review** promotes `_proposed_classification` into the main `research_area`/`methodology` fields, removes the proposal block, and flips `lifecycle: proposed → current`. Observed end-to-end.

## S5 — Obsidian + Zotero GUI  → records S5, G4

Run the [GUI test plan](gui-test-plan.md) on the Windows side and **fully complete its Results table**:

- [ ] **Part A** — all bundled plugins load/enable; REST round-trip; settings verified (no "didn't verify" caveat).
- [ ] **Part B** — Zotero + Better BibTeX export works; the capture macro fires.
- [ ] **Part C (G4)** — all five system dashboards plus the five `spaces/` surfaces render on real data (Dataview queries and Bases embeds resolve), including the ingested note + entities from G10.
- [ ] **Part D — Bases render check.** Open every shipped `.base` in Obsidian and confirm each view renders without a YAML/format error: `catalog/catalog.base` (entity views), `inbox/inbox.base` ("Needs me" + "All cards" — also embedded by the Inbox queue), `notes/hubs/hubs.base`, `projects/projects.base`, `system/board/board.base`, `system/dashboards/claims.base` / `sources.base` / `fleeting.base`, `system/patterns/patterns.base`, `system/worklists/worklists.base`. The format is young and our CI only schema-syncs properties — rendering is verifiable only in the app.

## G5 — telemetry signals  → records G5

```bash
hermes cron run memoria-board-export        # or: hermes cron tick
python src/.memoria/mcp/board_export.py --cost-doctor
ls -l "$RV/system/logs/"{board-state,board-transitions,audit,lint-findings,cost}.jsonl
```

- [ ] `board-state`, `board-transitions`, `audit`, and `lint-findings` all gain rows from the live activity above.
- [ ] The cost doctor passes before live export trusts the Hermes session-store join; any missing cost rows are counted in `cost-misses.jsonl`, not treated as zero.
- [ ] Resolve at least one `work-prompt` through `Memoria: resolve inbox card` with **Dismiss** and confirm `attention.jsonl` plus `triage.jsonl` gain one row from the human action surface.

## G7 — no High-priority blockers

- [ ] Memoria Issue Tracker has no open issue with Priority `High` that blocks the release.

## G8 + cut mechanics  → records G8, then ships

Only after every row above is green:

- [ ] Confirm `version: vX.Y.0` across the five `src/.memoria/profiles/*/distribution.yaml`.
- [ ] **Version + CHANGELOG + tag + GitHub Release** are owned by **release-please** — merge its open release PR; that cuts the tag, finalizes `CHANGELOG [vX.Y.0]`, and publishes the Release. Don't hand-tag or hand-edit the CHANGELOG. (See [Releases](../../releasing/README.md).)
- [ ] Flip `released: false → true` / `status: draft → released` in that release's `release-plan-<v>.md` frontmatter.
- [ ] Close the release's **"Release vX.Y" parent issue** + the milestone, rolling any unfinished issues to the next milestone.
