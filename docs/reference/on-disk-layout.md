# On-disk layout

Where every file lives across the two filesystem roots: the starter vault (versioned, distributable) and `.memoria/` (tooling layer). For the design rationale see [explanation/architecture/](../explanation/architecture/).

**Implementation note.** Items marked `# pending` are designed but not yet present in the v0.1 starter vault. Items marked `# deferred` are planned for a future version. See [implementation-status.md](../../project-files/plans/implementation-status.md) for build state.

## Repo root and vault root

There are two roots. The **repo** is the install unit — cloned anywhere; the bootstrap
copies `vault/` to your chosen **runtime vault** folder (default `~/Memoria`, deliberately
off OneDrive). Both folder names are free; the internal shapes are fixed. The install
scripts live in **`scripts/`**, not inside the vault.

```text

## Vault skeleton: human-facing notes

Notes in `00-meta/` that ship with the starter vault for human reference.

| Note | Purpose | Maintained by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `00-meta/index.md` | Vault landing page. Pinned in sidebar. Links to system status, dashboards, lane views, key files. | Human (rarely changes) |
| `00-meta/research-directions.md` | Current research priorities, open questions, synthesis gaps, papers to prioritize. Librarian reads this at session start. | Human (refresh weekly) |
| `00-meta/system-status.md` | Runtime health snapshot: Hermes API running, MCPs up, plugin enabled, profiles available. Distinct from `board-state` (which tracks work in flight). | Human (occasional refresh) |
| `00-meta/04-reference/getting-started.md` | First-time setup checklist — 5 steps from clone to first ingest. | Human (rarely changes) |
| `00-meta/04-reference/system-map.md` | High-level architecture summary in plain language. Vault-resident companion to `docs/explanation/architecture/`. | Human (sync with design changes) |
| `00-meta/04-reference/agent-roles.md` | Plain-language one-paragraph summary of each Hermes profile. Mirrors each `SOUL.md`. | Human (sync with profile changes) |
| `00-meta/04-reference/profile-policies.md` | Plain-language who-can-write-where summary. Tracks the lane-override YAML files. | Human (sync with lane-override changes) |
| `00-meta/04-reference/schema-reference.md` | Canonical list of every frontmatter field, type, and allowed values. Source of truth for templates and the Linter. | Human + Linter (flags drift) |
| `00-meta/04-reference/dataview-cheatsheet.md` | Reference patterns for dashboard queries — TABLE / LIST / TASK / FROM / WHERE / SORT / FLATTEN / LIMIT examples. | Human (rarely changes) |
| `00-meta/04-reference/performance-checklist.md` | Dashboard performance discipline for Dataview query authors. | Human (rarely changes) |
| `00-meta/04-reference/safe-mode.md` | The three core workflows (ingest, review, export) with minimal commands and fallbacks for when Hermes or ACP is down. | Human (rarely changes) |
| `00-meta/04-reference/obsidian-config.md` | Plugin inventory and load-bearing settings the human should not change. Mirrors `docs/reference/obsidian-plugins.md`. | Human (sync with plugin changes) |
| `00-meta/04-reference/design-system.md` | Canonical visual-style source: palette, typography, spacing, layout, motion, voice. Drives CSS snippet generators and Pandoc export configs. | Human (edits define the brand) |

The Linter's `skeleton-drift` detector flags notes whose `updated` timestamp lags the corresponding design file.

## File naming conventions

| Artifact | Convention | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Note files | `kebab-case.md` | `receptivity-detection-timing.md` |
| Paper notes | Citekey as filename | `mamykina2010sense.md` |
| Template files | `<type>.md` | `claim.md`, `paper.md` |
| Dashboard files | `kebab-case.md` | `weekly-review.md` |
| Lane-override files | `<short-name>.yaml` | `librarian.yaml` |
| Profile dirs | `memoria-<name>/` | `memoria-librarian/` |
| Log files | `kebab-case.jsonl` | `audit.jsonl` |

**Constraint:** No spaces in vault file names. Hermes path handling and shell scripts do not support them.
