# On-disk layout

Where every file lives. The repo ships the vault under **`src/`**; the installer scaffolds the folder skeleton in your chosen runtime vault (default `~/Memoria`) and populates it from `src/` ([ADR-55](../adr/55-src-scaffold-populate-golden-copy.md)). Repo and deployed vault have the same internal shape; the deployed vault additionally grows the runtime-only artifacts listed at the end. The tree itself is fixed by [ADR-47](../adr/47-type-first-category-folders.md): five type-first category folders, with the type → folder map living in `src/.memoria/schemas/folders.yaml`. `.memoria/` is never opened by the PI; if a workflow tells the PI to open a `.memoria/...` path, that workflow is wrong.

## The vault tree

```text

```

The five vault-root categories (`catalog`, `notes`, `projects`, `inbox`, `system`) are the legal top-level set — the Linter flags any stray root folder. The gated and transient prefixes those subfolders carry are declared in `folders.yaml`, not hardcoded; what they mean is in [Note types](note-types.md).

## `.memoria/` — the runtime tooling layer

Hidden from Obsidian; everything agents and engines need, shipped in `src/.memoria`:

```text

Runtime-only (created in the deployed vault, never shipped):

| Path | Created by | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.memoria/golden/` | installer (`golden.py stage`) | The restorable golden copy of every system file + `manifest.json` (SHA-256). |
| `.memoria/data/extracts/` | ingest MCP | Full-text extracts per citekey — outside the Librarian's write lane. |
| `.memoria/data/retraction_watch.csv` | retraction refresh cron | The local Retraction Watch index. |
| `.memoria/.venv/` | installer | The vault-local Python the MCP servers run on. |
| `.git/hooks/pre-commit` | installer | The schema commit gate (once the vault is a git repo). |

---

## `.obsidian/` — app configuration

Shipped in `src/.obsidian`: `app.json`, `appearance.json`, `core-plugins.json`, `community-plugins.json`, `graph.json` (link color-groups), `snippets/`, and per-plugin config under `plugins/` (QuickAdd, Commander, Modal Forms, agent-client, Local REST API, Homepage, Buttons, Dataview, Templater, Citation, Callout Manager, Obsidian Git). `src/.obsidian/workspaces.json` ships the three saved layouts — **Desk**, **Library**, and **Studio** (see [Obsidian workspaces](obsidian-workspaces.md)).

### The Bases views

The `.base` files sit alongside their data: `catalog/catalog.base`, `inbox/inbox.base`, the `claims`/`sources`/`fleeting` bases in `system/dashboards/`, and `system/patterns/patterns.base` ([ADR-49](../adr/49-catalog-in-bases-linter-monitor.md)). What each view shows is in [Dashboards](dashboards.md#the-bases-views).

---

## Outside the vault

| Path | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `<repo>/scripts/` | `install.sh` / `install.ps1`, `docs-doctor.py`, test drivers — install tooling never deploys into the vault. |
| `~/.hermes/profiles/memoria-*/` | The deployed profile copies (config substituted, `.env` seeded). |
| `~/.hermes/scripts/` | The substituted cron wrappers (`memoria-sweeps.sh`, `memoria-lint.sh`, `memoria-board-export.sh`, …), copied and renamed from the repo's `.memoria/scripts/<job>-cron.sh`. |
| `~/.hermes/.env` | The global secrets file the installer propagates per profile. |
